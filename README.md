# Snake-and-ladders-api
A Snake and Ladder API would typically provide a way to interact with the game programmatically. Hereâ€™s a hypothetical description of what such an API might look like:

Game Initialization Endpoint (/game/init): This endpoint might be used to start a new game. It could accept parameters like the number of players and return a unique game ID for the session.

Roll Dice Endpoint (/game/{gameId}/roll): This endpoint could simulate rolling a dice. It might accept the game ID and the player ID as parameters, and return the result of the dice roll.

Move Player Endpoint (/game/{gameId}/move): This endpoint might accept the game ID, player ID, and the number of steps to move as parameters. It could return the new position of the player on the board.

Game Status Endpoint (/game/{gameId}/status): This endpoint could provide the current status of the game. It might return information like the positions of all players, whether there are any snakes or ladders ahead, and so on.

End Game Endpoint (/game/{gameId}/end): This endpoint might be used to end a game prematurely. It could accept the game ID as a parameter.

Remember, this is just a hypothetical description and actual implementations may vary based on specific requirements and design decisions.
